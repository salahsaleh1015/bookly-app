// important notes

/* 1.  clean architecture is a layered architecture
each layer has its own responsibility & communicate with other layers
*/


/* 2.  clean architecture is a consists of 3 layers
presentation layer, domain layer, data layer
 but domain layer is the entry point of the application
 because it is tell us how the application will work
*/


/* 3.  the difference between models and entities in clean architecture
/*
the models are responsible for mapping the json data to dart classes and vice versa
the entities are responsible for presenting the data to the user ( data representation )
*/


/* Data Layer

1- models are the entry point in this layer
2- models are responsible for mapping the json data to dart classes and vice versa
3- models will be changed t entities in the domain layer Using OOP principle ( Inheritance )
